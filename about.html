I am a CS student currently taking Software Engineering course.
I have been doing programming only recently, around a year ago as of writing this.
I'm interested in Functional Programming, Backend programming, and some more niche Software stuff.
I use Arch (btw). Well it's actually EndeavourOS but it's still Arch under the hood, so...

Also, I'm currently learning Rust as my main programming language, since I find it really fun to work with.
It's kind of difficult but I'm getting there! Hopefully I'll be able to write decent software with it 
before next year.

Other stuff I'm known for is being an avid yuri consumer. It's pretty much what I mostly talk about on my socials.
I think it's the most beautiful thing ever! Maybe you should try it out sometimes, maybe you'll like it. Who knows...

I don't think I have another hobbies other than reading, honestly. I do play games sometimes, though.
Most of the time whenever I'm not reading yuri I just spend them studying or listening to ASMR and music.
Not like I can focus on much stuff since I have ADHD (undiagnosed) so I struggle with any kinds of distraction a LOT.
That pretty much explains why I'm still not decently good enough at programming stuff.
